# 🏦 Simple Bank Application (Python)

This is a beginner-friendly **Python console application** that simulates basic banking operations.  
It was built as a practice project to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals like functions, loops, conditionals, and variable scope.

- The program starts with a default balance of **Rs. 1000.00**.  
- The user is repeatedly shown a **menu** until they choose to exit.  
- Options available:
  1. **Check Balance** → Shows current account balance.  
  2. **Withdraw Money** → Deducts entered amount if funds are sufficient.  
  3. **Deposit Money** → Adds entered amount if it’s positive.  
  4. **Exit** → Ends the program.
